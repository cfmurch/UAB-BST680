    "section": "Adding parts",
    "text": "Adding parts\nThe gt package makes it relatively easy to add parts so that the resulting gt Table better conveys the information you want to present. These table parts work well together and there the possible variations in arrangement can handle most tabular presentation needs. The previous gt Table demonstrated had only two parts, the Column Labels and the Table Body. The next few examples will show all of the other table parts that are available.\nThis is the way the main parts of a table (and their subparts) fit together:\n\n\n\nThe parts (roughly from top to bottom) are:\n\nthe Table Header (optional; with a title and possibly a subtitle)\nthe Stub and the Stub Head (optional; contains row labels, optionally within row groups having row group labels and possibly summary labels when a summary is present)\nthe Column Labels (contains column labels, optionally under spanner column labels)\nthe Table Body (contains columns and rows of cells)\nthe Table Footer (optional; possibly with footnotes and source notes)\n\nThe way that we add parts like the Table Header and footnotes in the Table Footer is to use the tab_*() family of functions. A Table Header is easy to add so let’s see how the previous table looks with a title and a subtitle. We can add this part using the tab_header() function:\n\n# Make a display table with the `islands_tbl`\n# table; put a heading just above the column labels\ngt_tbl_2 &lt;- gt::tab_header(\n  data = gt_tbl_1,\n  title = \"Large Landmasses of the World\",\n  subtitle = \"The top ten largest are presented\"\n)\n\n# Show the gt Table\ngt_tbl_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge Landmasses of the World\n\n\nThe top ten largest are presented\n\n\nname\nsize\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n16988\n\n\nAfrica\n11506\n\n\nNorth America\n9390\n\n\nSouth America\n6795\n\n\nAntarctica\n5500\n\n\nEurope\n3745\n\n\nAustralia\n2968\n\n\nGreenland\n840\n\n\nNew Guinea\n306\n\n\nBorneo\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Header table part provides an opportunity to describe the data that’s presented. The subtitle, which functions as a subtitle, is an optional part of the Header. We may also style the title and subtitle using Markdown! We do this by wrapping the values passed to title or subtitle with the md() function. Here is an example:\n\n# Use markdown for the heading's `title` and `subtitle` to\n# add bold and italicized characters\n\ngt_tbl_3 &lt;- gt::tab_header(\n  data = gt_tbl_1,\n  title = md(\"__Large Landmasses of the World__\"),\n  subtitle = md(\"The *top ten* largest are presented\")\n)\n\n# Show the gt Table\ngt_tbl_3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge Landmasses of the World\n\n\nThe top ten largest are presented\n\n\nname\nsize\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n16988\n\n\nAfrica\n11506\n\n\nNorth America\n9390\n\n\nSouth America\n6795\n\n\nAntarctica\n5500\n\n\nEurope\n3745\n\n\nAustralia\n2968\n\n\nGreenland\n840\n\n\nNew Guinea\n306\n\n\nBorneo\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA source note can be added to the table’s footer through use of the tab_source_note() function. It works in the same way as tab_header() (it also allows for Markdown inputs) except it can be called multiple times—each invocation results in the addition of a source note.\n\n# Display the `islands_tbl` data with a heading and\n# two source notes\n\ngt_tbl_4 &lt;- gt::tab_source_note(\n  data = gt_tbl_3,\n  source_note = \"Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406.\"\n)\n\ngt_tbl_5 &lt;- gt::tab_source_note(\n  data = gt_tbl_4,\n  source_note = md(\"McNeil, D.R.

    "title": "Introduction to Quarto and gt",
    "section": "The stub",
    "text": "The stub\nThe Stub is the area to the left in a table that contains row labels, and may contain row group labels, and summary labels. Those subparts can be grouped in a sequence of row groups. The Stub Head provides a location for a label that describes the Stub. The Stub is optional since there are cases where a Stub wouldn’t be useful (e.g., the display tables presented above were just fine without a Stub).\nAn easy way to generate a Stub part is by specifying a stub column in the gt() function with the rowname_col argument. Alternatively, we can have an input dataset with a column named rowname—this magic column will signal to gt that that column should be used as the stub, making row labels. Let’s add a stub with our islands_tbl dataset by modifying the call to gt():\n\n# Create a gt table showing ten of the\n# largest islands in the world; this\n# time with a stub\ngt_tbl_1 &lt;- gt::gt(islands_tbl, rowname_col = \"name\")\n\n# Show the gt Table\ngt_tbl_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n16988\n\n\nAfrica\n11506\n\n\nNorth America\n9390\n\n\nSouth America\n6795\n\n\nAntarctica\n5500\n\n\nEurope\n3745\n\n\nAustralia\n2968\n\n\nGreenland\n840\n\n\nNew Guinea\n306\n\n\nBorneo\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the landmass names are off the the left in an unstriped area? That’s the stub. We can apply what’s known as a stubhead label. This label can be added with the tab_stubhead() function:\n\n# Generate a simple table with a stub\n# and add a stubhead label\ngt_tbl_1 &lt;- gt::tab_stubhead(data = gt_tbl_1, label = \"landmass\")\n\n# Show the gt Table\ngt_tbl_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlandmass\nsize\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n16988\n\n\nAfrica\n11506\n\n\nNorth America\n9390\n\n\nSouth America\n6795\n\n\nAntarctica\n5500\n\n\nEurope\n3745\n\n\nAustralia\n2968\n\n\nGreenland\n840\n\n\nNew Guinea\n306\n\n\nBorneo\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very important thing to note here is that the table now has one column. Before, when there was no stub, two columns were present (with column labels name and size) but now column number 1 (the only column) is size.\nTo apply our table parts as before (up to and including the footnotes) we use the following statements:\n\n# Display the `islands_tbl` data with a stub,\n# a heading, source notes, and footnotes\n\n# Make a display table with the `islands_tbl`\n# table; put a heading just above the column labels\ngt_tbl_2 &lt;- gt::tab_header(\n  data = gt_tbl_1,\n  title = md(\"__Large Landmasses of the World__\"),\n  subtitle = md(\"The _top ten_ largest are presented\")\n)\n\ngt_tbl_3 &lt;- gt::tab_source_note(\n  data = gt_tbl_2,\n  source_note = \"Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406.\"\n)\n\ngt_tbl_4 &lt;- gt::tab_source_note(\n  data = gt_tbl_3,\n  source_note = md(\"McNeil, D.R.

(1977) Interactive Data Analysis. Wiley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s incorporate row groups into the display table. This divides rows into groups, creating row groups, and results in a display of a row group labels right above the each group. This can be easily done with a table containing row labels. We can make a new row group with each call of the tab_row_group() function. The inputs are group names in the group argument, and row references in the rows argument. We can use any of the strategies to reference rows as we did we footnotes (e.g., vectors of names/indices, select helpers, etc.).\nHere we will create three row groups (with row group labels continent, country, and subregion) to have a grouping of rows.\n\n# Add a column to islands_tbl\nislands_tbl$group &lt;- c(\n  \"Continents\",\n  \"Continents\",\n  \"Continents\",\n  \"Continents\",\n  \"Continents\",\n  \"Continents\",\n  \"Other\",\n  \"Other\",\n  \"Other\",\n  \"Other\"\n)\n\ngt_tbl_1 &lt;- gt::gt(islands_tbl, rowname_col = \"name\", groupname_col = 'group')\ngt_tbl_2 &lt;- gt::tab_stubhead(data = gt_tbl_1, label = \"landmass\")\n\ngt_tbl_3 &lt;- gt::tab_header(\n  data = gt_tbl_2,\n  title = md(\"__Large Landmasses of the World__\"),\n  subtitle = md(\"The _top ten_ largest are presented\")\n)\n\ngt_tbl_4 &lt;- gt::tab_source_note(\n  data = gt_tbl_3,\n  source_note = \"Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406.\"\n)\n\ngt_tbl_5 &lt;- gt::tab_source_note(\n  data = gt_tbl_4,\n  source_note = md(\"McNeil, D.R.

(1977) Interactive Data Analysis. Wiley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo row groups have been made since there are two unique categories under groupname. Across the top of each row group is the row group label contained in a separate row (these cut across the field and they contain nothing but the row group label). A rearrangement of rows is carried out to ensure each of the rows is collected within the appropriate row groups.\nHaving groups of rows in row groups is a great way to present information - let’s make it even cleaner. The tab_style() function lets you access and modify any conceivable part of your table. In this example, we’ll access the rows that describe groups and then we’ll set their text to be bold.\n\ngt_tbl_6 &lt;- gt::tab_style(\n  data = gt_tbl_5,\n  locations = cells_row_groups(), \n  style = cell_text(weight = 'bold')\n)\n\ngt_tbl_6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge Landmasses of the World\n\n\nThe top ten largest are presented\n\n\nlandmass\nsize\n\n\n\n\nContinents\n\n\nAsia\n16988\n\n\nAfrica\n11506\n\n\nNorth America\n9390\n\n\nSouth America\n6795\n\n\nAntarctica\n5500\n\n\nEurope\n3745\n\n\nOther\n\n\nAustralia\n2968\n\n\nGreenland\n840\n\n\nNew Guinea\n306\n\n\nBorneo\n280\n\n\n\nSource: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406.\n\n\nMcNeil, D.R.

We will also talk about including data summaries particular to each group is a natural extension of this idea.

    "text": "Overview\nThe gapminder data are related to a famous TED talk given by Hans Rosling. In his talk, Dr. Rosling shows an animated visualization depicting the relationship between life expectancy and average income levels by country. Our goal in this module is to reproduce Dr. Rosling’s visualization.\nWe will access the gapminder data from the gapminder R package. This package contains a dataset (technically, a tibble) called gapminder with 6 variables:\n\n\n\nvariable\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\ncountry\ncountry\n\n\ncontinent\ncontinent\n\n\nyear\nyear\n\n\nlifeExp\nlife expectancy at birth\n\n\npop\ntotal population\n\n\ngdpPercap\nper-capita GDP\n\n\n\nPer-capita GDP (Gross domestic product) is given in units of international dollars, “a hypothetical unit of currency that has the same purchasing power parity that the U.S. dollar had in the United States at a given point in time” – 2005, in this case.\nNote: the gapminder R package exists for the purpose of teaching and making code examples. It is an excerpt of data found in specific spreadsheets on Gapminder.org circa 2010. It is not a definitive source of socioeconomic data.\n\n\nPackages\nLoad the tidyverse and gapminder packages. We are using tidyverse to access the ggplot2 package and using gapminder to access the data.\n\n\nInspect your data\nIn gapminder, each country has 12 rows distinguished by year.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nCreate a scatter plot using gdpPercap as the x-variable and lifeExp as the y-variable:\n\n\nCode\n# your plot should look like this:\nread_rds('solutions/01_solution.rds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################\n\nggplot(data=gapminder) + \n  aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nModify your figure from exercise 1: transform the scale of your x-axis to be in log base 10 units. (See ?scale_x_log10)\n\n\nCode\n# your plot should look like this:\nread_rds('solutions/02_solution.rds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################\n\nggplot(data=gapminder) + \n  aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nAdd x- and y-axis labels to your figure from exercise 2.\n\n\nCode\n# your plot should look like this:\nread_rds('solutions/03_solution.rds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nAdd a smoothed curve to your plot, showing the overall population trend. (See ?geom_smooth)\n\n\nCode\n# your plot should look like this:\nread_rds('solutions/04_solution.rds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nAdjust the points in your graph:\n\nSet their shape to be 21\nSet their color to be 'black'\nSet their fill to be 'grey'\n\nAdjust the overall population trend as well:\n\nSet the line’s color to be 'red'\nRemove the standard errors (shaded region around the line) from the plot.\n\n\n\nCode\n# your plot should look like this:\nread_rds('solutions/05_solution.rds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nGo to the ggplot2 theme() reference page and scroll through the pictures that show some of the built-in ggplot2 themes. Pick a theme that you like and add it to the figure you created in exercise 5.\n\n\nCode\n# your plot should look like this:\nread_rds('solutions/06_solution.rds')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nThere is something happening in the upper levels of income. The population trend between income and life expectancy changes direction. There is an R package called plotly that can help you explore ggplot figures interactively. Converting a ggplot2 figure into a plotly figure is straightforward:\n\n#First call the library\nlibrary(plotly, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\n\n\n# step 1: create a ggplot2 figure\n\n# step 2: if you want to see data for individual points in your\n#         graph, you can add the label values using aes(), like this:\ngg_figure &lt;- read_rds('solutions/06_solution.rds') + \n  aes(label = country)\n  \n# step 3: use ggplotly on the figure\nggplotly(gg_figure)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can tell by hovering your mouse over the far right points in the figure that the higher income but lower life expectancy country is Kuwait. Now, re-create this figure, but use year as a label instead of country, and identify the years that account for these points.\nOnce you’ve seen the year values associated with the points in the upper-income but lower than expected life expectancy, formulate a hypothesis explaining your data. After you’ve written your hypothesis down, go to Wikipedia’s Kuwait page and read about their modern history. Was your hypothesis correct?\n\n#######################\n###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###\n#######################",
