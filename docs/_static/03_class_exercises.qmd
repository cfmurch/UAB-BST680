## Overview

These exercises will help you practice what you have learned about functions and vectors.

# Packages

We'll load the tidyverse and the gt package, since these are all we need to complete the exercises.

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(gt)
library(tidyverse)

```

# Vectors

The two vectors needed to complete the exercises are created below.

```{r}
#| echo: false

cases <- read_rds('solutions/cases_byday.rds')

days <- read_rds('solutions/days_since_2020-01-22.rds')

```

# Exercise 1

How many cases were diagnosed on the 10th, 25th, and 50th day?

```{r}

###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###

```

Your output should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/01_solution.rds')

```

# Exercise 2

How many total cases were diagnosed on or before day 50?

```{r}

###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###

```

Your output should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/02_solution.rds')

```

# Exercise 3

Find the first day when the number of new cases exceeded 50.

```{r}

###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###

```

Your output should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/03_solution.rds')

```

# Exercise 4

How many days have had 1000 or more new cases identified?

```{r}

###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###

```

Your output should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/04_solution.rds')

```

# Exercise 5

Create a vector containing the mean, median, minimum, and maximum values of `cases`. Give the vector names that correspond with these terms, i.e., `c("Mean", "Median", "Min", "Max")`.

```{r}

###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###

```

Your output should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/05_solution.rds')

```

# Exercise 6

Learn something new! There is a function in the `tibble` package called `enframe()`. This function transforms a named vector into a `tibble`, i.e. a dataframe, with columns `name` and `value`. The `name` column holds the vector's names and the `value` column holds the vector's values.

Use the `enframe()` function on the named vector from the previous exercise. Then, use what you learned last week about the `gt` package to create the table below:

```{r}

###YOUR CODE HERE!!!###

```

Your output should look like this:

```{r}

read_rds('solutions/06_solution.rds')

```
